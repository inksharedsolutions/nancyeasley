                              Have you been bewildered by all the diverse
                              options proposed as “the way” to Christlikeness?
                              If so, you are not alone. Feasting with the Trinity
                              sketches the way forward, based on two biblical observations.
                              Kendell Easley presents feasting with the Trinity as a grand
                              metaphor for living and enjoying the Christian life.
